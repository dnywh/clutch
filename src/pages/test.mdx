description: I updated this description via Pages CMS

This is my Colophon. Kind of like an extended README for nerds who want to know how this site is made. Like the README, it's really just me who goes in and looks stuff up from time to time.

## CMS

This is using [Pages CMS](http://pagescms.org) for easy on-the-go text-only posts, like Bits (tweets). I got this idea from [Rach Smith](https://rachsmith.com/pages-cms/). As of writing this, my pages.yml file controls:

*   This very test page
    
*   The notes collection
    

I access it via [app.pagescms.org](https://app.pagescms.org). Any changes to the above page(s) or collection(s) frontmatter or fields should be reflected in that .pages.yml file.

Title should be above. Begin markdown content from body of file...

I might turn this into my Colophon. So why not use this as a running list of important features.

## CMS

This is using [Pages CMS](http://pagescms.org) for easy on-the-go text-only posts, like Bits (tweets). I got this idea from [Rach Smith](https://rachsmith.com/pages-cms/). As of writing this, my pages.yml file controls:

- This very test page
- The notes collection

I access it via [app.pagescms.org](https://app.pagescms.org). Any changes to the above page(s) or collection(s) frontmatter or fields should be reflected in that .pages.yml file.
